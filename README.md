## Self-paced workshop

This workshop should have all the content necessary to learn how to run Cypress on continuous integration service. Use the example application and follow the written steps above. I suggest starting with the introduction and then picking one of the topics matching your situation. If you get stuck, or something is unclear, do not hesitate to open a GitHub issue in this repository to improve this workshop.

## Author

Gleb Bahmutov has PhD in Computer Science and has worked at Cypress.io for four years as VP of Engineering and Distinguished Engineer, and was heavily involved in all areas of the Test Runner development, as well as Cypress Dashboard features, plugin writing, and CI integration. He has spoken about Cypress approximately a hundred times at meetups and conferences, wrote 100s of blog posts about testing, and has recorded more than 150 Cypress videos available for free on his YouTube channel. Today, Gleb is still heavily using Cypress at a large company making sure its web applications are always working correctly.
