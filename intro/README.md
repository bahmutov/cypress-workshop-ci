**Warning: ‚ö†Ô∏è** this is not an introduction to Cypress testing workshop, only how to successfully run it in CI. If you need to refresh your Cypress skills, check out [bahmutov/cypress-workshop-basics](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-workshop-basics)

‚úÖ This workshop includes all the slides and links I am showing, so you can return to it later <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Logistics

### Time üï∞
- total workshop duration 3-4 hours
- 10 minute break after each hour

### Remote Workshop üñ•

### Questions ‚ÅâÔ∏è
- post to chat, I will try to answer them along the way

---
## Requirements

You will need:

- `git` to clone the repository
- Node v12+ to install and run locally
- üëâ fork the [bahmutov/cypress-workshop-ci-example](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-workshop-ci-example) now üëà

(or use `degit`, see the next slide üëá)

+++
**Alternative:** use [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit)

```shell
$ npx degit bahmutov/cypress-workshop-ci-example ci-example
$ cd ci-example
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "first commit"
```

+++
## Create free accounts

- GitHub [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
- CircleCI [https://circleci.com/](https://circleci.com/)

## Forked example repo

---
## Clone to local machine

```
git clone git@github.com:bahmutov/cypress-workshop-ci-example.git ci-example
cd ci-example
```

+++
## Inspect the application

```
$ ls -l
total 384
-rw-r--r--  1 gleb  staff     163 Mar 17 12:47 README.md
drwxr-xr-x  3 gleb  staff      96 Mar 17 12:47 cypress
-rw-r--r--  1 gleb  staff     116 Mar 17 12:47 cypress.json
-rw-r--r--  1 gleb  staff     597 Mar 17 12:47 index.html
-rw-r--r--  1 gleb  staff  177299 Mar 17 12:47 package-lock.json
-rw-r--r--  1 gleb  staff     865 Mar 17 12:47 package.json
```

It is a static site build with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)
+++
## Look at the NPM scripts
```
$ npm run
Lifecycle scripts included in ci-example:
  start
    eleventy --serve

available via `npm run-script`:
  build
    eleventy
  cy:open
    cypress open
  cy:run
    cypress run
```

+++
## Look at cypress.json

```
$ cat cypress.json
{
  "fixturesFolder": false,
  "supportFile": false,
  "pluginsFile": false,
  "baseUrl": "http://localhost:8080"
}
```
+++
## Look at cypress/integration

```bash
$ cat cypress/integration/spec.js
```

```js
/// <reference types="cypress" />

describe('Example site', () => {
  it('loads', () => {
    cy.visit('/')
    cy.contains('h1', 'cypress-workshop-ci-example').should('be.visible')
  })

  it('navigates to README', () => {
    cy.visit('/')
    cy.contains('a', 'README').click()
    cy.location('pathname').should('equal', '/README/')
  })

  it('goes directly to README', () => {
    cy.visit('/README')
    cy.contains('h2', 'README')
  })

  it('redirects to README/', () => {
    cy.visit('/README/')
    cy.contains('h2', 'README')
  })
})
```

## How do I run the site locally?

- from the terminal `npm start`
  - the app starts at `localhost:8080`

```
$ npm start

> cypress-workshop-ci-example@1.0.0 start /Users/gleb/git/cypress-workshop-ci-example-fork
> eleventy --serve

+++
## What does the app build?

- output folder `_site`
- production build `npm run build`

```
$ npm run build

> cypress-workshop-ci-example@1.0.0 build /Users/gleb/git/cypress-workshop-ci-example
> eleventy

+++
## Run tests locally

While the application is running in one terminal, from the second terminal exeucute `npm run cy:open`

![Cypress tests running locally](./images/tests.gif)

---
## Continuous Integration

Build the app and run the tests on CI
- on every commit
- on every pull request

Goal ü•Ö is to have the full confidence in the deployed application
